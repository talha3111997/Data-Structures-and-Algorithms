Probelem Statement:
1. Implement the counting sort and radix sort algorithms as per pseudo code using C++.
2. Now sort the arrays using stl::sort, once in ascending order and then in descending order. Given both sorted arrays as inputs to both algorithms and compute their running time. Plot the running time of the best and worst case complexities for different input sizes in a excel sheet and add it in the solution section.
